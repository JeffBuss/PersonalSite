Is it an issue to have extra text families

I originally tried to set up the header w/o using a list, but
couldn't figure out getting everything to line up. I'm sure
there's a more efficient way to do this, and would love to
know what it is. Having both nav and ul containing everything
seemed like overkill, but it finally worked after banging my
head against the wall for far too long so I left it.

Sidenote: the logo was heavily influenced by my love of hexagons and hatred
for Beats by Dre headphones. It's borderline plagiarism in its
current state, please don't kick me out of Turing. Let Dre's
legal team handle my punishment when I become well-known
enough for him to care.

Should I switch h1 and h2? I seem to have better keywords
for search engines throughout the page w/in h2s currently.

Also definitely want to improve the copy on my bio, as well as add
to it. Want to keep things short and simple, but this is
poorly worded and vague. Still conveys some information about
my past, my mindset, and my goals in a couple sentences though.

      <!--
It's midnight, and I just realized I forgot to put my education
in this section. Would've probably left it out as I'd rather
have info regarding non-related fields I work/study in on my
linkedin, but it was a part of the requirements for the project.
I'll just take the points off at this point so my mind can be fresh
for tomorrow since Javascript scares me lol.

In the future I'd like to sylize the text, add the dates I worked,
and git (leaving the spelling error) these box classes to always
extend to the right border regardless of how much text is in them.
